As you step into the jungle, the first thing that hits you is the smell - the smell of rotting flesh. As your eyes adjust to the gloom, you see in the distance, about 50 yards away, a massive rotting carcass, decomposed to the point of unrecognizability. It makes you nearly throw up, but as you're about to run around and head back to the beach, you notice a low bunker just beyond the carcass. You ponder which way to go.

Your curiousity gets the better of you. You pinch your nose and approach the bunker.
