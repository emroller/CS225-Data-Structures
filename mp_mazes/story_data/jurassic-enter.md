Your speedboat has just crashed on the shore of a tropical, mountainous island after getting stuck in a freak storm. After a while, you regain consciousness, and find yourself on a misty beach, lying next to the ruins of your boat. In front of you stretches miles more of beach. To your right, at the edge of the sand, towers a dark, sprawling jungle. You consider which way to proceed.

With some trepidation, you cuff up your sleeves and head towards the jungle edge.
