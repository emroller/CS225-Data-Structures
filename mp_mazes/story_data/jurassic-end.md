As you approach the mysterious figure at the end of the hall, you realize there is something familiar about it. Its tall, slim silhouette strikes you as both mysterious and recognizable. As you approach the figure, cautiously and curiously and eagerly all at once, you notice the outline of a turtleneck sweater and round wire-frame glasses on the figure. And the nose, prominent and pointed, as well as the scruffy facial hair only make you more certain that you know this man - it's definitely a man - from somewhere. But from where?

As you continue down the hall, you have an epiphany as to who this mysterious silhouette belongs to. It's... Steve Jobs, the former CEO of Apple Inc.? But how could it possibly be him? Steve Jobs died years ago (eight to be precise), and as far as you know, no one has yet discovered how to bring dead people back to life.

"He- hewwo?" you say timidly, almost blushing. If your intiuitions are right and this IS Steve Jobs, you're in the presence of one of the biggest idols of your entire life. You can't afford this miss this chance to meet your biggest stan.

Suddenly, the hallway lights come on, nearly blinding you, and Steve Jobs is revealed in his full glory. 

"Owo!" you exclaim, taken by surprise.

"Hello," replies Steve, smiling mysteriously at you. "Welcome. You've made it."

You're now even more baffled than ever by this curious statement. You're not really sure where you could have possibly "made it" to; you just stumbled upon this building by accident.

"I- I guess," you say. "Thanks? But where am I? And what is the former CEO of Apple Inc. doing here?"

Steve's smile widens. "You haven't guessed yet?" he asks. "Did you think that you had survived the boat crash that landed you here? No, no, no. You're dead, my dear, and I'm here to guide you to the afterlife. Welcome to Purgatory, featuring yours truly. Let's get started."
